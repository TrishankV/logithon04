      "2.Continuous\n",
      "automated, prescheduled,\n",
      "continued code tests as application code is being written or updated. Such tests can\n",
      "speed the delivery of code to production.\n",
      "3.Continuous integration (CI):-This practice brings configuration management\n",

      "code being developed is ready for production. It involves rapid feedback between\n",
      "testing and development to quickly identify and resolve code issues.\n",
      "4.Continuous delivery:- This practice automates the delivery of code changes, after\n",
      "testing, to a preproduction or staging environment. An staff member might then\n",
      "decide to promote such code changes into production.\n",
      "5.Continuous deployment (CD):- Similar to continuous delivery,\n",
      "this practice\n",
      "automates the release of new or changed code into production. A company doing\n",
      "continuous deployment might release code or feature changes several times per day.\n",
